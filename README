nullBB is a cool minimal CMS forum. Just the coolest CMS forum you've ever wished.

== Installation ==

Take a VERY DEEP LOOK to the config.ini file in your base directory. Everything you
need to know and more, it's inside of there. Just follow the steps inside of there,
in particular COMMENT OR SET TO FALSE THE $UNCONFIGURE VARIABLE once you've
configured your CMS, set the BASEDIR macro to your installation directory inside your
web server (e.g., if you have installed nullBB in $SERVDIR/nullbb, e.g.
/var/www/htdocs/nullbb, BASEDIR should be /nullbb/), set the ABSOLUTE_BASEPATH (e.g.
/var/www/htdocs/nullbb/) and the parameters to connect to your database (db name,
user, pass, host). Once you've modified config.ini the way you like, access to the
URL of your brand new nullBB installation (e.g. http://yoursite.com/nullbb), set your
admin username, password and email, and everything is ready.

Oh, I forgot, so far nullBB requires ModRewrite to be enabled and the RewriteEngine
enabled in your installation's base directory. Just specify the right AllowOverride
option in your httpd.conf file to enable .htaccess support onto your installation
directory.

== Themes ==

If you want to create a new theme, just take a look at the default themes in /themes
directory, and do the same. A theme in nullBB is just a CSS file contained inside
/themes/THEMENAME directory. Just put your theme there, and it's ready to be used.

== Languages ==

nullBB supports multiple languages contents. All you have to do to add a new language
support, it's to add a .lang file in /languages directory. Just take a look at the
default files to see how to do it.
